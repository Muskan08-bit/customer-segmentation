## 🔍 Objective:
To segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior and demographics, enabling personalized marketing strategies and improving customer retention.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
2. Clustering Algorithm: K-Means Clustering
3. Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Skills Applied: 
Feature Engineering, Unsupervised Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Customer Segmentation

## 📈 Key Insights:
1. Four Distinct Customer Segments Identified:
2. High spenders with high frequency of purchases
3. Low spenders with occasional purchases
4. Loyal customers with consistent spending patterns
5. New or irregular customers with low engagement

## Behavioral Patterns:
1. High-frequency buyers are primarily from major cities and fall in the younger age categories.
2. Discount sensitivity is higher among low spenders, providing an opportunity for targeted discount campaigns.

## Demographic Trends:
Gender and age are strong differentiators in purchasing habits and segment membership.

## Cluster Analysis:
Elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K=4).

## ✅ Recommendations:
1. Create loyalty programs for consistent high-frequency buyers to encourage lifetime value growth.
2. Design re-engagement campaigns for irregular customers with targeted promotions.
3. Personalize marketing strategies based on segment behavior and demographics to maximize conversion rates.
4. Focus discounts and promotional efforts on the low spender segment to boost transaction volume.

## 🧠 What I Learned:
This project enhanced my ability to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to real-world business challenges. It also strengthened my skills in interpreting clustering results and making data-driven business recommendations.
